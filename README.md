You may wonder what the fuck is this repo \
It was an early trying to work with Telegram CLI\
If you were old school telegram bots developer, you may know that in the old times, History of Making Bots had two chapters\
Before Supergroups and After Supergroups\
after anouncing supergroup feature by telegram, all current bots had a new problem, which is working in supergroups.\
on that days a new telegram client has been anounced which was totally incompatible with our source codes like Legacy TeleSeed and many others that i cant remember.\
Yeah long story short, this repo is my first tries with that new client and it was very successful and if you wonder why i keep this weird repo, because its part of my history and i want to keep it around.
